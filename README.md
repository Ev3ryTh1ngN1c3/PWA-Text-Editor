## Description

This project is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that functions as a text editor, allowing users to create <br>
& save notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection. The application utilizes IndexedDB <br>
for local storage, includes a service worker for offline functionality & can be installed as a PWA. Users can <br>
easily navigate the intuitive interface to write & save content, making it accessible for later use. 
  
## Usage 

- open the application in a supported browser <br>
- write & edit text in the text editor <br>
- save your content by clicking on the save button <br>
- your content will be automatically saved when the window is unfocused <br>
- access your saved content even when offline <br>
- navigate through the application using the intuitive interface <br> 
- install the application as a Progressive Web App for easy access

## Project Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to create a reliable & versatile text editor that operates as a <br>
Progressive Web Application (PWA). By leveraging PWA technology, the aim was to provide users with a seamless <br>
experience of creating, saving & accessing notes or code snippets both online & offline. This project <br>
showcases the power of PWAs for enhancing user experience & accessibility, making it easier for users to <br> manage their content across various devices & network conditions.

## What Was Learned

Through this project, we gained valuable insights & skills in developing Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) <br>
with advanced features : <br>

- implemented IndexedDB for local storage to enable offline functionality <br>
- created a service worker with Workbox to cache static assets <br>
  & ensure the application works without an internet connection <br>
- utilized webpack for bundling the application <br>
- integrating Babel to use async/await for asynchronous operations <br>
- generating a `manifest.json` file using the WebpackPwaManifest plugin for PWA installation <br>
- enhanced user experience by providing an intuitive & polished interface for the text editor <br>
- understanding the importance of PWAs in modern web development <br>
  & their benefits for users in terms of reliability & accessibility
